What is ``EXPOsan``?
--------------------
The ``EXPOsan`` package contains systems developed using the `QSDsan <https://github.com/QSD-Group/QSDsan>`_ package. Please refer to the individual README files within each system module for loading instructions and exemplary results.


Installation
------------
The easiest way is through ``pip``, in command/Anaconda prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS):

.. code:: bash

    pip install exposan

You can also download the package from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/exposan/>`_.

To get the git version (use the ``depth`` flag to choose how many commit histories you want to clone):

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/QSD-Group/EXPOsan.git --depth=1


.. note::
   
   Using the ``depth`` flag will only clone the main branch, if there are other branches and you want them, then use the ``no-single-branch`` flag, i.e.

   .. code:: bash

       git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/EXPOsan.git --depth=1 --no-single-branch
