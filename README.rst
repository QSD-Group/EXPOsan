What is ``EXPOsan``?
--------------------
The ``EXPOsan`` package contains systems developed using the `QSDsan <https://github.com/QSD-Group/QSDsan>`_ package. A list of the developed systems is included in QSDsan's `documentation <https://qsdsan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Developed_Systems.html>`_. Please refer to the individual README files within each system module for loading instructions and exemplary results.


Installation
------------
The easiest way is through ``pip``, in your command-line interface (e.g., Anaconda prompt, terminal):

.. code:: bash

    pip install exposan

If you need to upgrade:

.. code::

    pip install -U exposan

or for a specific version (replace X.X.X with the version number):

.. code::

    pip install exposan==X.X.X

If you want to install the latest GitHub version at the `main branch <https://github.com/qsd-group/exposan>`_ (note that you can still use the ``-U`` flag for upgrading):

.. code::

    pip install git+https://github.com/QSD-Group/EXPOsan.git


.. note::

   If this doesn't give you the newest ``exposan``, try ``pip uninstall exposan`` first.

   Also, you may need to update some ``exposan``'s dependency package (e.g., ' ``qsdsan``, ``biosteam``, ``thermosteam``) versions in order for the new ``exposan`` to run.


or other fork and/or branch (replace ``<USERNAME_OF_THE_FORK>`` and ``<BRANCH_NAME>`` with the desired fork and branch names)

.. code::

    pip install git+https://github.com/<USERNAME_OF_THE_FORK>/EXPOsan.git@<BRANCH_NAME>


You can also download the package from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/exposan/>`_.


To get the git version (use the ``depth`` flag to choose how many commit histories you want to clone):

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/QSD-Group/EXPOsan.git --depth=1

then navigate into the repository (``cd EXPOsan``) and install the required packages:

.. code:: bash

    pip install â€“r requirements.txt


.. note::
   
   Using the ``depth`` flag will only clone the main branch by default, if there are other branches and you want them, then use the ``no-single-branch`` flag, i.e.

   .. code:: bash

       git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/EXPOsan.git --depth=1 --no-single-branch
